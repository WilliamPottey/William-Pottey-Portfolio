# William Pottey's Portfolio

This is a personal project I have been working on to get hands on experience with front-end web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript + React.js.
Currently I do not have a domain to host the website, but will in the near future.

In the future I plan to create new pages and add more of my person projects to the "Personal Projects" section.
