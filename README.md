# William Pottey's Portfolio

This is a personal project I have been working on to get hands on experience with front-end web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript + React.js.
Currently I do not have a domain to host the website, but will in the near future.

In addition, I have used Node.js Node Package Manager (npm) to install Vite to work alongside React.js and have incorporated the Bootstrap framework to help with some component visualization/UI development.

In the future I plan to create new pages and add more of my personal projects to the "Personal Projects" section.
