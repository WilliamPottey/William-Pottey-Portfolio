# William Pottey's Portfolio

This is a personal project I have been working on to get hands on experience with front-end web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript + React.js.
You can access the page here: https://williampottey.github.io/William-Pottey-Portfolio/

In addition, I have used Node.js Node Package Manager (npm) to install Vite and other packages in order to work alongside React.js and have incorporated the Bootstrap framework to help with some component visualization/UI development.

In the future I plan to create new pages and add more of my personal projects to the "Personal Projects" section.
